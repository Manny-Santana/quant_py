# quant_py 

`quant_py` is a book i am reading through with practical problems to learn python for quantitative finance.
It is a goal of mine to work in finance someday. There is a lot of self teaching that i need to do in order to make this dream a reality but i am no stranger to this path. 

See you at the finish line.
